# Ethereal Email Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Ethereal Account Details

Your app is now configured to use your specific Ethereal email account:

- **Name**: Bettye Eichmann
- **Username**: bettye.eichmann@ethereal.email  
- **Password**: CRdFAaXpVBAu9Huq9G

## ðŸ“§ Viewing Emails

1. **Go to**: https://ethereal.email
2. **Login with**:
   - Email: `bettye.eichmann@ethereal.email`
   - Password: `CRdFAaXpVBAu9G`

## ðŸš€ Railway Configuration (Optional)

To use these credentials explicitly on Railway, add these environment variables:

```
ETHEREAL_USER=bettye.eichmann@ethereal.email
